                <p>Hello, my name is Zander. I am 18 years old and currently studying Data and Communication with a specialization as a computer technician focusing on programming.</p>
                <p>I chose this education because I have a strong interest in technology, systems, and especially software development – both front end and back end.</p>
                <p>I love understanding how things work behind the scenes and how to build something from scratch that looks good and functions efficiently.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I often enjoy coding at home.</p>
                <p>This can be anything from small websites to more complex web applications, which I create to improve my skills and keep myself sharp.</p>
                <p>I find it fun to combine the creative with the technical – especially when it all comes together perfectly.</p>
                <p>Besides my interest in programming, I also have a dog named Kobe. He is an important part of my daily life and makes sure I take breaks from the screen now and then.</p>
